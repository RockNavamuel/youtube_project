**Project Description**

In this project, I gathered real channel data using YouTube's API and conducted analysis for content creators.

**Data Source:**

- Collected using YouTube API


**The Steps:**

- Source data (YouTube API)

- Data cleansing

- Create a PostgreSQL database on AWS

- Connect database to SQL server

- Exploratory analysis of data using Python/SQL server

- Model #1: Relationship between View Count and Like Count (Linear Regression)

- Model #3: Optimal time to post (Random Forest Classification)

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) via word cloud and Sentiment Analysis

**Findings (View 'YouTube_Data_Analysis' file for in-depth analysis of findings.)**

- Within the channel for user SypherPK, videos containing content centered around Fortnite and other popular gaming creators received popularity and positive sentiment from viewers. To leverage income from YouTube, the creator could leverage content scheduling optimization and promotional ads, as the models yielded statistically relevant results to predict virality.
